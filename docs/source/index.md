# Engine Documentation

Welcome to the Onyx Engine documentation!

The Onyx Engine is your team's workspace for managing and collaborating on AI physics models trained directly from your hardware's data. AI solves real-world accuracy for controls teams' critical physics models. The Onyx Engine platform can serve as your team's virtual AI engineer.

The onyx-engine library is an API for optimizing AI models to simulate and control hardware systems.
The library is lightweight, easy to interface with, and works alongside the Onyx Engine Platform.

If you're ready to train and optimize your first model, check out {ref}`installation`.
